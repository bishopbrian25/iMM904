"""Mass consistency analysis of metabolic databases

A stoichiometric matrix, S, is said to be mass-consistent if
S^Tm = 0 has a positive solution (m_i > 0). This corresponds to
assigning a positive mass to each compound in the stoichiometric
matrix and having each reaction preserve mass. Exchange reactions
will have to be excluded from this check, as they are not able to
preserve mass (by definition). In addition some databases may contain
pseudo-compounds (e.g. "photon") that also has to be excluded.
